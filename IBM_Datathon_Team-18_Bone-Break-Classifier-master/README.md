# Bone-Break-Classifier
The **Bone Break Classifier** can accurately classify the given input image as the correct class of Fracture. This project can predict an image among 12 different classes of fracture. The project classifies the images using Convolutional Neural Network and Deep Learning.

## How we built it
These are steps we followed to successfully build the **Bone Break Classifier** aka  the Fracture Classifier.
1. Collecting Data: We decided to use google images to build our dataset. The dataset consists of 1750 images which has around 150+ images for the 12 different types of fractures.
2. Data cleaning and preparation: We first removed the unwanted images and then performed resizing and scaling of the images.
3. Choosing and Training the Model: We decided to use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to build our model and trained it with some sample test images. A convolution is the simple application of a filter to an input that results in an activation. 
4. Evaluating the Model: The metrics used for evaluating our model was accuracy and loss.

5. Prediction by the Model: We used a sample test data to test our model and verify its classification. 

The model was successfully able to classify most of the fracture images correctly.

### This Machine Learning model was built during IBM ZDatathon and Won the Special Call out Prize. This project was ranked 4th among 100+ teams
